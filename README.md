# Ratings3
Ratings is a program I developed in my first computer science class. Often you can find that ratings on YouTube or Amazon can't be too trustworthy as while that song or product may have 5 stars, only 3 people may have rated it. The potential for an untrustworthy rating lessens as more ratings are created. My Ratings project adds ratings to different videos or products in order to assist users in determining whether or not a rating is trustworthy. This is done through adding average ratings to the rating in question. If there are very few ratings, the added average ratings may drastically change the rating, telling you maybe that original rating wasn't too trustworthy as not enough people rated it for it to remain as it was. On the other hand, if there was a lot of ratings and you added the average ratings, that original rating would not change too much or at all, signifying that the video or song does in fact have a more trustworthy rating.
